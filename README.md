TLC5940-based multi-function board

Depending on the assembled components this can be one of the following:
<<1>> 16-channel servo control board \n
<<2>> 16-led bar display with idividual led dimming \n
<<3>> 5xRGB-led board, each with individial color \n

In each use case multiple board can be chained with regular 2,54mm jumpers (7x).
RGB-LEDS are spaced 10.0mm so that multiple 50mm x 50mm boards will extend the chain.
